## ⚡ Post-install tweaks

Run these commands after the first boot:

sudo pmset autopoweroff 0  
sudo pmset powernap 0  
sudo pmset standby 0  
sudo pmset proximitywake 0  
sudo pmset tcpkeepalive 0  

These settings:  
- Disable autopoweroff: Prevents hibernation-related wake issues  
- Disable powernap: Prevents periodic network wakeups  
- Disable standby: Prevents transition to hibernation after sleep  
- Disable proximity wake: Prevents wake triggered by nearby iPhone / Apple Watch  
- Disable TCP Keep Alive: Prevents wake-ups every 2 hours due to network

## 💡 Notes

- macOS version: **Sonoma 14.5 (Olarila image)**
- Resizable BAR must remain **disabled**
- iMacPro1,1 SMBIOS is used for better stability on this setup
- OpenCore boot-args include:  
  keepsyms=1 debug=0x100 agdpmod=pikera revpatch=sbvmm -ctrsmt=full -v  
- The `SecureBootModel` is set to `Disabled` by default for installation ease and compatibility. You may enable it to `Default` after installation for improved security and system integrity.
