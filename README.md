## ‚ö° Post-install tweaks

Run these commands after the first boot:

sudo pmset autopoweroff 0  
sudo pmset powernap 0  
sudo pmset standby 0  
sudo pmset proximitywake 0  
sudo pmset tcpkeepalive 0  

These settings:  
- Disable autopoweroff: Prevents hibernation-related wake issues  
- Disable powernap: Prevents periodic network wakeups  
- Disable standby: Prevents transition to hibernation after sleep  
- Disable proximity wake: Prevents wake triggered by nearby iPhone / Apple Watch  
- Disable TCP Keep Alive: Prevents wake-ups every 2 hours due to network
